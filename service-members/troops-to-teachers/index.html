                                            Prior research on Troops to Teachers (TTT) from 2005 and 2009 using both principal surveys and measured student achievement affirms that Troops teachers are effective instructors, are likely to work in high-poverty, high-minority schools, teach critical subjects, use research-based instructional and classroom management practices, and plan to stay in the profession longer than traditionally prepared teachers with the same years of teaching experience. The Owings Study finds that the current TTT cohorts are meeting the same high benchmarks in these essential domains, identifies teacher preparation programs factors that helped them succeed in the classroom, and assesses these within the context of recent teacher effectiveness research.
