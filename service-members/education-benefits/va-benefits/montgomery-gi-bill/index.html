                            <p>Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) benefits are available for service members and veterans to help with education and training costs by providing more than $51,000 in cash and numerous support programs.</p>

                                    	<p>The MGIB is available for those who enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces. It includes both the Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty (Chapter 30) and The Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve (Chapter 1606).</p>
                                        <p class="solo">Under Chapter 30, Active Duty members enroll and pay $100 per month for 12 months. They are then entitled to receive a monthly education benefit once they have completed a minimum service obligation. Under Chapter 1606, a reservist must be actively drilling and have a 6-year obligation in the Selected Reserve to be eligible.</p>

                                        <p class="solo">The value of the MGIB is based on the current maximum monthly payment rate of $1,473 multiplied by the 36-month limit. This "payment rate" automatically adjusts for inflation on the first of October each year. You get current payment rate no matter when you became eligible or begin using it.</p>
