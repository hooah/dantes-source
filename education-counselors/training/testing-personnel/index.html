                                        <p>To get TCO training you must be nominated by your headquarters/major command in order to be granted access to the online Test Control Officer (TCO) Academic Testing Course. Once you have access, the online course provides comprehensive, standardized TCO training in a self-paced, 24/7 delivery mode.</p>
                                        <p>A potential TCO/ATCO candidate must be nominated by their headquarters/major command before they will be allowed access to the online TCO Academic Testing Course. Once the TCO nomination package is received at DANTES, the DANTES administrator will establish an account to allow access to the system. The system automatically sends a "welcome" email to the new student, including login and password information.</p>
                                        <p>While the course is estimated to take 3 days, the student has 30 days to complete the course and final exam. The system notifies DANTES of successful completion, which is then documented in the nomination package. For DANTES Test Sites located in Europe and the Middle East, the headquarters/major command must contact <a href="mailto:dantes@eur.army.mil">dantes@eur.army.mil</a>.<br /><br /></p>

                                        <p>Military Education Centers interested in establishing a base-sponsored National Test Center (NTC) coordinate with a local or on-base institution (college or university), the base Commanding Officer and DANTES. The advantages of having a NTC on or near base are many. Computer-based testing reduces administrative work associated with paper-based test administration; DANTES funds the test and examination fee, and students receive instant score results.</p>
                                        <p>At the base-sponsored NTC, the institution is responsible for providing staff, computers, technical support, and Internet connection. If the NTC can be located on station, the base provides the room/space for the computer lab. It is a win-win situation for the institution if they already have a computer lab, as it maximizes the use of their computers and generates funding to maintain and operate their facility. Service membersâ€™ pay nothing while testing on base and receive instant score results.</p>
