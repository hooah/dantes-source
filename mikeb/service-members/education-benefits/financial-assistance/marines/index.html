This degree plan is developed by the college after the college has evaluated the SMART and previous college credits (if applicable). The degree plan lists all the classes required for the degree/certificate and what the student still needs to accomplish to earn the degree/certificate. Once the student has received 12 semester hours of TA authorizations, the Marine Corps will NOT fund additional courses until the evaluated degree plan is delivered to our office. Navy is allowed 5 TA funded classes before a degree plan is required.</p>
