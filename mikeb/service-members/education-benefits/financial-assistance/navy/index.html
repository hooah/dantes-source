                                        <p class="smallish">Tuition Assistance (TA) is the Navy's educational financial assistance program. It provides active duty personnel funding for tuition costs for courses taken in an off-duty status at a college, university or vocational/technical institution, whose regional or national accreditation is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. A list of approved accrediting agencies may be found at <a href="http://www.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg6.html#NationallyRecognized" target="_blank">http://www.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg6.html#NationallyRecognized</a> for a list of national accrediting agencies; or on this same web page click on "Regional Institutional Accrediting Agencies" to see list of regional accrediting agencies. Navy TA pays for both classroom and independent study/distance learning courses, regardless of course length. Courses must be offered in Semester Hours, Quarter Hours or Clock Hours. The credit earned must show on the institution's transcript.</p>
                                        <p class="smallish">All Navy Tuition Assistance pays up-front the tuition and specific fees charged by educational institutions for course enrollments. Navy TA pays 100% of tuition costs for courses applicable to the completion of a high school diploma or equivalency certificate. For other education levels, there is a fiscal year credit limit of 16 Semester Hours, 24 Quarter Hours or 240 Clock Hours (or a combination of) per individual.</p>
