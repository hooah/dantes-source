Active Duty officers incur an Active Duty Service Obligation (ADSO) of two years and Reserve Component officers incur a Reserve Duty Service Obligation (RDSO) of four years. The ADSO/RDSO is calculated from the date of completion of the last course for which TA was used. Non-Army service members must obtain TA through their branch of Service. This policy has been mutually agreed upon by all Services. Further details on the provisions of TA are found in AR 621-5.

Tuition assistance (TA) is money the Coast Guard pays to colleges and universities for the tuition costs of courses you take from them. TA is available to all uniformed personnel (regular and drilling Reservists), civilian Coast Guard employees, and commissioned Public Health Service officers who are serving with the Coast Guard. For those who meet the eligibility criteria, the Coast Guard currently pays tuition costs for academic courses as follows: (Currently, the Coast Guard does not authorize TA for vocational or clock-hour courses.) All courses for which you want to use TA must be taken from nationally or regionally accredited institutions.  Also, to qualify for TA, the credit you earn for a course must be required for your degree program. Currently, TA is not authorized for courses for which you Continuing Education Units (CEUs), Professional Development Units (PDUs), non-accredited clock hours, or non-accredited contact hours. The following conditions are now in effect, on top of those which previously existed (under the horizontal line below). In addition, applicants must: Before commands can approve a TA application, \"COs, OICs, or the first O-6/GS-15 in the chain-of-command\" must ensure that applicants meet the above eligibility criteria (see ALCOAST 175/13, paragraph 4).  Commands are free to use any means they want to record the fact that they've verified that the above criteria were met. In addition to the rules above, TA is not authorized for any of the following: Many people who are taking college courses using TA don't realize that certain fees are covered by TA.  These include: Fees and costs not directly related to the course you are taking (e.g., fees all students must pay regardless of the course they're taking) are not covered by TA.  These include things like: If TA doesn't cover the whole cost of a course and if you're eligible for benefits under either the Montgomery GI Bill (Active Duty) or the Post-9/11 GI Bill you can use an option called Top-up. Top-up allows you to get reimbursed for any costs not covered by TA. Tuition and certain fees not covered by TA will show up on your TA authorization under the heading STU SHARE (student share), which means you have to pay for them.  However, if you want to use Top-up to cover those costs, just print out a copy of your TA authorization, print TOP UP across the top of the form, and send it to the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA). If you had to pay for fees you couldn't list on your TA request, you may receive Top-up reimbursement for them, as well. But you will need documentation showing that those fees were not included on your TA authorization and send it with the documentation described above to the DVA. Your 36-month GI Bill entitlement will be reduced by a certain amount when you use Top-up. To calculate the amount of time which will be deducted from your entitlement, go here if you're eligible for new (Post-9/11) GI Bill benefits, or here if you're eligible for Montgomery GI Bill (Active Duty) benefits. Officers (regular and Reserve) incur service obligations when they use TA.  Specifically, regular officers incur a two-year service obligation for each course they use TA to pay for.  The obligation begins on the date the most recent course taken ends.  For Reserve officers, the obligation is for four years.  Read ALCOAST 012/09 for the complete policy. These obligations run concurrently, not consecutively.  That is, if you use TA to pay for another course that ends before a previous obligation ends, your obligation is extended to the date that's two or four years after the date you completed the most recent course paid for with TA.

Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) benefits are available for service members and veterans to help with education and training costs by providing more than $51,000 in cash and numerous support programs. The MGIB is available for those who enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces. It includes both the Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty (Chapter 30) and The Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve (Chapter 1606). Under Chapter 30, Active Duty members enroll and pay $100 per month for 12 months. They are then entitled to receive a monthly education benefit once they have completed a minimum service obligation. Under Chapter 1606, a reservist must be actively drilling and have a 6-year obligation in the Selected Reserve to be eligible. The value of the MGIB is based on the current maximum monthly payment rate of $1,473 multiplied by the 36-month limit. This \"payment rate\" automatically adjusts for inflation on the first of October each year. You get current payment rate no matter when you became eligible or begin using it. Your MGIB can be used to pay for many different programs, including: You will receive 36 months of benefits. This time period refers to academic months, which means you will have up to eight semesters (four years) of traditional academic education. Benefits under the MGIB generally end 10 years from the date of your last discharge or release from active duty, but some extenuating circumstances qualify for extensions. For example, if you rejoin active service for more than 90 days during that 10-year period, you will have 10 years from the date of your last discharge. Search for upcoming examination dates.

REAP (Chapter 1607) is an education program that provides up to 36 months of education benefits to members of the Selected Reserves, Individual Ready Reserve and National Guard called to active duty in response to a war or national emergency (contingency operation) as declared by the President or Congress. A member of a Reserve component who serves on active duty on or after September 11, 2001 under title 10, U.S. Code, for at least 90 consecutive days under a contingency operation, is eligible for REAP. National Guard members are eligible if their active service extends for 90 consecutive days or more and their service is: Individuals are eligible as soon as they reach the 90-day point whether or not they are currently on active duty. The Department of Defense (DoD) will identify contingency operations that qualify for benefits under chapter 1607. The educational assistance allowance payable under REAP is a percentage of the Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty (MGIB) rate based on the number of continuous days served on active duty. Service members released before 90 days due to an injury, illness, or disease incurred or aggravated in the line of duty receive the 40 percent rate. The amount that VA pays is based on the type of training program and training time (i.e. full time, half time, etc).

More Information More Information More Information * DANTES does not have college or university catalogs to provide to service members. Students may view school catalogs on the web. Home page web links for all of the schools in the DANTES Catalogs are available from the online catalogs. Students should examine institution requirements, course descriptions, costs, course delivery and testing requirements before enrolling.                                               Some courses have prerequisites. There may be other requirements that must be completed prior to enrolling in a course or degree program. The school catalog or school advisor can provide this information. Students must receive education center counseling and approval prior to enrollment if tuition assistance is requested. If a student enrolls without going through an education center, tuition assistance may be denied.                                                                                                                                       Counselors recommending courses should consider the ability and experience of the student. Unless the student has demonstrated successful completion of distance learning courses, enrollment in one course at a time is generally recommended.                                                                                                                                       Locally conducted and attended college or university courses usually are best for most students. However, if a desired course or degree is not available or cannot be taken because of the student's duty schedule, a distance learning course may be able to provide a satisfactory alternative.                                                                                         Students planning to enroll in courses found in the DANTES catalogs must contact the school to register and enroll. * Before enrolling in a course or degree program, students should consider the possibility of receiving credit through the Military Evaluations Program (using the ACE Guide at http://militaryguides.acenet.edu), and through the DANTES Credit-By-Examination program. Many of the SOC (Service members Opportunity Colleges at http://www.soc.aascu.org) schools also offer contracts-for-degree in which specific use of nontraditional credit is itemized (and usually maximized) for military students. ** Before applying to any school, students need to determine if they can meet the school's requirements for course cost, term lengths, delivery modes, student-to-instructor contacts, and testing policies. Students also need to be aware of the school's drop/add date for each course, policies for awarding \"W, F, and I\" grades, and all refund policies and dates. Some degree programs require on-campus residency. Students need to be aware of all these details to determine if they can meet all of the school's policies and should enroll in courses with a particular school. In general, subject to specific Service policies, specified dollar limits, yearly caps, and availability of funding, students will be provided either up-front or reimbursable tuition assistance which may cover 100% of their tuition and fees. * Students should contact their Service education counselors for current tuition assistance policies and requirements, as these frequently change. It is the student's responsibility to know and understand their Service's tuition assistance policy. ** Students may be required to make a separate payment to the school bookstore for books and materials. *** Although schools agree to notify DANTES before changing tuition and generally attempt to avoid changing fees during a school year, prices can change before they are entered into the online Catalogs or the current CD ROM edition of the DANTES Catalogs is issued. Students should always check with the school to determine the correct price before enrolling. Some schools permit installment payments. This agreement is between the student and the school. The student must pay all costs before the school will issue a grade report. * Encourage students to discuss refund policies with schools before enrolling or before signing contracts. This will help students avoid later misunderstandings about refunds.                                               Books are the student's responsibility, and no reimbursement is made for these expenses.

A student may consider a distance learning course to meet prerequisites, accelerate degree completion, complete courses not conducted locally, complete courses when TDY or duty prevent class attendance, gain personal enrichment and satisfaction, or prepare for a second career. Some students find that independent study is their preferred method of learning.

ACT Assessment Test (ACT)                                                      The ACT Assessment test is an admissions requirement at some colleges. The instrument consists of a battery of four academic tests that measure academic development in English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science Reasoning. The Assessment provides scores on the four tests, a composite score, and seven sub scores which provide more detailed information concerning an individual's academic development.                                                                                                         SAT Reasoning Test (SAT)                                                      The SAT scores are used as a college admission requirement and student placement instrument. SAT scores provide colleges with a way to compare academic preparation and abilities of students who apply for admission. SAT, when used in conjunction with high school grades and class rank, serves as a good predicator of academic success in the first year of college.                                                                                                         DANTES funds one administration at a DANTES Test Center, for eligible military service members, on either the SAT or the ACT Assessment. DANTES Test Centers do not schedule SAT administrations in July and August as the SAT Program shuts down their scoring system in late summer to prepare for national testing in October. We recommend that you use the ACT during this period. For additional information about testing at DANTES Test Centers see your education advisor.

This test is broken up into Quantitative, Verbal, and Integrated Reasoning questions so that you can demonstrate your ability in several skills required to be successful in graduate school.

These Subject tests measure achievement in specific fields of study and mastery of the concepts, principles, and knowledge basic to success in specific graduate fields.                                                                                                         PRAXIS                                                      PRAXIS tests measure basic skills in reading, writing, and mathematics and include multiple-choice questions and an essay question on the Writing test. The tests are designed to evaluate whether you have the academic skills needed to prepare for a career in education.
