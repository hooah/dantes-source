                            If you've already taken our suggested test, you can request a transcript or score card be sent to your college of choice.
                            When requesting a transcript or grade report, be very specific as to where it is to be sent. Include any office symbol, code or particular person at the institution that is to receive the transcript (i.e., admissions, evaluations, graduation, etc).

                            What you need to know about the Montgomery GI Bill
                            Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) benefits are available for service members and veterans to help with education and training costs by providing more than $51,000 in cash and numerous support programs.
                            
							
                            		
                            			Am I Eligible?
                            		
                            		
                                        The MGIB is available for those who enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces. It includes both the Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty (Chapter 30) and The Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve (Chapter 1606).
                                        Under Chapter 30, Active Duty members enroll and pay $100 per month for 12 months. They are then entitled to receive a monthly education benefit once they have completed a minimum service obligation. Under Chapter 1606, a reservist must be actively drilling and have a 6-year obligation in the Selected Reserve to be eligible.
                                    
                                
	                            
                            		
                            			What Will I Receive?
                            		
                            		
                                        The value of the MGIB is based on the current maximum monthly payment rate of $1,473 multiplied by the 36-month limit. This "payment rate" automatically adjusts for inflation on the first of October each year. You get current payment rate no matter when you became eligible or begin using it.
                                    
                                
	                            
                            		
                            			What Kind of Training Can I Take?
                            		
                            		
                                        Your MGIB can be used to pay for many different programs, including:
                                        College, business, technical or vocational courses
                                            Distance learning – including correspondence courses
                                            Apprenticeship/job training (Veterans and Reserve only)
                                            Flight training
                                            Licensing and certification exams
                                        
                                
	                            
                            		
                            			How Many Months of Assistance Will I Receive?
                            		
                            		
                                        You will receive 36 months of benefits. This time period refers to academic months, which means you will have up to eight semesters (four years) of traditional academic education.
                                    
                                
	                            
                            		
                            			How Long am I Eligible?
                            		
                            		
                                        Benefits under the MGIB generally end 10 years from the date of your last discharge or release from active duty, but some extenuating circumstances qualify for extensions. For example, if you rejoin active service for more than 90 days during that 10-year period, you will have 10 years from the date of your last discharge.

                            What you need to know about the Post-9/11 GI Bill
                            The Post-9/11 GI Bill offers benefits for service members and veterans attending education and training programs taken at accredited colleges or universities, or accredited non-college institutions that grant degrees. It gives current and previously activated National Guard and Reserve members the same benefits as active duty service members.

                            What you need to know about the Veterans' Educational Assistance Program (VEAP)
                            The Veterans' Educational Assistance Program (VEAP) is an educational assistance program that is available if you elect to make contributions from your military pay to participate. The government matches your contributions on a $2 for $1 basis. The maximum contribution is $2,700.

                                        To qualify, you must meet the following requirements:
                                        Entered service for the first time between January 1, 1977 and June 30, 1985
                                            Opened a contribution account before April 1, 1987
                                            Voluntarily contributed from $25 to $2,700
                                            Completed your first period of service
                                            Were discharged or released from service under conditions other than dishonorable
                                        If you are currently on active duty and wish to receive VEAP benefits, you must have at least three months of contributions available.
                                        Contributions may be withdrawn if you do not meet the basic eligibility requirements or if you formally request a refund of the contributions withheld.
                                    
                                
	                            
                            		
                            			How Long Am I Eligible?
                            		
                            		
                                        Benefit entitlement is one to 36 months, depending on the number of monthly contributions. You have 10 years from your release from active duty to use VEAP benefits. If there is entitlement not used after the 10-year period, your portion remaining in the fund will be automatically refunded.
                                    
                                
	                            
                            		
                            			What Will I Receive?
                            		
                            		
                                        Your payment amount will depend on the type and hours of training pursued. The maximum amount is $300 a month for full-time training. VEAP participants may receive the same training, work-study benefits and counseling as provided under the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB), with the exception of preparatory courses.

                                        VEAP benefits can be used for many different programs, including:
                                        College, technical or vocational courses
                                            Vocational flight training
                                            Apprenticeship/on-the-job training
                                            Correspondence courses
                                            Certificate programs
                                        
                                
	                            
                            		
                            			How Do I Apply?
                            		
                            		
                                        In certain circumstances, remedial, deficiency and refresher training may also be available.
                                        You should make sure that your selected program is approved for VA training. If you are not clear about this, VA will inform you and the school or company about the requirements.
                                        Obtain and complete VA Form 22-1990, Application for Education Benefits. Send it to the VA regional office with jurisdiction over the State where you will train.
                                            If you are not on active duty, send copy 4 (Member Copy) of your DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty. If you are on active duty, you must have your enrollment approved by your base Education Services Officer, and you must have your service verified by your Commanding Officer.
                                            If you have started training, take your application and Member Copy of DD Form 214 to your school or employer. Ask them to complete VA Form 22-1999, Enrollment Certification, and send all the forms to VA.
                                            If you wish to withdraw your contributions from VEAP, obtain and complete VA Form 22-5281, Application for Refund of Educational Contributions, and send it to your nearest VA regional office.

                            What you need to know about the Reserve Education Assistance Program (REAP) (Chapter 1607)
                            REAP (Chapter 1607) is an education program that provides up to 36 months of education benefits to members of the Selected Reserves, Individual Ready Reserve and National Guard called to active duty in response to a war or national emergency (contingency operation) as declared by the President or Congress.
                            
							
                            		
                            			Am I Eligible?
                            		
                            		
                                        A member of a Reserve component who serves on active duty on or after September 11, 2001 under title 10, U.S. Code, for at least 90 consecutive days under a contingency operation, is eligible for REAP.
                                        National Guard members are eligible if their active service extends for 90 consecutive days or more and their service is:
                                        Authorized under section 502(f), title 32, U.S. Code
                                            Authorized by the President or Secretary of Defense for a national emergency
                                            Supported by federal funds
                                        Individuals are eligible as soon as they reach the 90-day point whether or not they are currently on active duty. The Department of Defense (DoD) will identify contingency operations that qualify for benefits under chapter 1607.
                                    
                                
	                            
                            		
                            			How Long Am I Eligible?
                            		
                            		
                                        The educational assistance allowance payable under REAP is a percentage of the Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty (MGIB) rate based on the number of continuous days served on active duty. Service members released before 90 days due to an injury, illness, or disease incurred or aggravated in the line of duty receive the 40 percent rate.
                                        Members who serve 90 days but less than 1 year will receive 40 percent of the MGIB 3-year rate.
                                            Members who serve 1 year but less than 2 years will receive 60 percent of the MGIB 3-year rate.
                                            Members who serve 2 or more continuous years will receive 80 percent of the MGIB 3-year rate.
										The amount that VA pays is based on the type of training program and training time (i.e. full time, half time, etc). If attendance is less than a month or less than full-time, payments are reduced proportionately.

This degree plan is developed by the college after the college has evaluated the SMART and previous college credits (if applicable). The degree plan lists all the classes required for the degree/certificate and what the student still needs to accomplish to earn the degree/certificate. Once the student has received 12 semester hours of TA authorizations, the Marine Corps will NOT fund additional courses until the evaluated degree plan is delivered to our office. Navy is allowed 5 TA funded classes before a degree plan is required.

                            Marine Tuition Assistance (TA) is available for all active duty and active reserve Marines.
                            Tuition assistance is available to Reservists on continuous active duty and their course must end prior to demobilization/deactivation. TA is offered to Officers but must agree to remain on active duty for two years.

                                        What is Tuition Assistance?
                                    
                                    
                                        Tuition Assistance (TA) is the Navy's educational financial assistance program. It provides active duty personnel funding for tuition costs for courses taken in an off-duty status at a college, university or vocational/technical institution, whose regional or national accreditation is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. A list of approved accrediting agencies may be found at http://www.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg6.html#NationallyRecognized for a list of national accrediting agencies; or on this same web page click on "Regional Institutional Accrediting Agencies" to see list of regional accrediting agencies. Navy TA pays for both classroom and independent study/distance learning courses, regardless of course length. Courses must be offered in Semester Hours, Quarter Hours or Clock Hours. The credit earned must show on the institution's transcript.
                                        All Navy Tuition Assistance pays up-front the tuition and specific fees charged by educational institutions for course enrollments. Navy TA pays 100% of tuition costs for courses applicable to the completion of a high school diploma or equivalency certificate. For other education levels, there is a fiscal year credit limit of 16 Semester Hours, 24 Quarter Hours or 240 Clock Hours (or a combination of) per individual.
                                        Payment for tuition and fees will not exceed the following caps:

                                        $250.00 per semester hour

                                        TA is available to both Naval Officer and Enlisted active duty personnel and some Naval Reservists on continuous active duty. It is also available to:

                                        Enlisted Naval Reservists ordered to active duty for 120 days or more
                                            Naval Reservist Officers ordered to active duty for 2 years or more.
                                        To qualify, service members must:

                                        Be on active duty for the whole length of the course.
                                            Attend an institution accredited by a regional, national, or professional accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.
                                            Receive counseling from a Navy College Office or a Virtual Education Center counselor
                                            Provide all grades from previously funded TA courses and reimburse all W and F grades. (Withdrawals for involuntary reasons may be granted with command verification.)
                                            Agree, if an officer, to remain on active duty for at least two years upon completion of courses funded by TA. This obligation runs concurrently with remaining obligated service time. Those who fail to serve the obligation must repay the TA funds expended on their behalf during the last two years of active duty on a pro-rated basis.

                                                Tuition Assistance (TA) is applied through WebTA. The process is defined below under TA Application Guidelines.

                                        What are the procedures to use TA?

                                        Contact your Navy College Office or the Virtual Education Center to receive educational counseling either in person, virtually, by phone or email. With your academic advisor, determine which courses will be requested for TA funding.
                                            
                                                Complete a TA Application in WebTA listing course(s) and fee(s). Check with your institution to make sure the amounts for tuition and fees you list are correct. Allowable fees that can be funded under Tuition Assistance are:

                                                Fees directly required for course enrollment may be combined with tuition. Navy will pay fees that are published, mandatory, and charged for course enrollment not to exceed the caps of $250.00 per semester hour/$166.67 per quarter hour/$16.67 per clock hour.
                                                    Mandatory non-reimbursable fees meeting the criteria listed above may be funded with TA. However, if the course is canceled allowing the tuition to be refunded, the student is responsible for paying the non-reimbursable fee.
                                                    Sailors requesting payment of fees with tuition are responsible for providing accurate fee information to their Navy College Office or Virtual Education Center when applying for TA.

                            What you need to know about financial assistance.
                            The U.S. Armed Forces offers several programs to support the education goals of service members (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard) – including up to 100 percent financial assistance for college courses taken during off-duty hours.

                             
                            Each service has its own criteria for eligibility, obligated service, application process and restrictions. This money is usually paid directly to the institution by the individual services.  You are eligible as long as you remain active duty.

                            State Tuition Policies
                            For periods of enrollment after July 1, 2009, members of the armed forces (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard) on active duty for a period of more than 30 days and his or her spouse, or his or her dependent children will be eligible to receive in-state tuition at public colleges and universities in the state where they reside or are permanently stationed. Once a Service member or their family members are enrolled and paying in-state tuition, they will continue to pay the in-state tuition rate as long as they remain continuously enrolled at the institution even if the Service member is reassigned outside the state.
                            This change is included in section 114 of the Higher Education Opportunity Act (H. R. 4137) (HEOA) which was signed into law on August 14, 2008 and amends and extends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA). This requirement applies to all public institutions that receive funds under a program authorized by the HEA.
                            The Department of Education has worked with the institutions of higher education and they are aware of the changes in the law and are fully implementing the policy. However, there is always the chance that an institution did not receive the information. If this happens, you should contact the financial aid or registrar's office at the institution. You can also contact the Veterans Affairs office at the institution. Even though you are active duty, these offices should be able to assist you. In the rare cases where these steps don't resolve the situation, please contact the Department of Education's Ombudsman's office (toll-free at 877 557-2575) or via the internet at http://studentaid.ed.gov/redirects/ombudsman-ed-gov.

                            TA is available to all uniformed personnel (regular and drilling Reservists), civilian Coast Guard employees.
                            Tuition assistance (TA) is money the Coast Guard pays to colleges and universities for the tuition costs of courses you take from them. TA is available to all uniformed personnel (regular and drilling Reservists), civilian Coast Guard employees, and commissioned Public Health Service officers who are serving with the Coast Guard.

                            
                                    
                                        Tuition Cost and Information
                                    
                                    
                                        For those who meet the eligibility criteria, the Coast Guard currently pays tuition costs for academic courses as follows:

                                        up to $250 per semester hour or
                                            up to $166.67 per quarter hour and
                                            up to a maximum of $4,500 per fiscal year
                                        (Currently, the Coast Guard does not authorize TA for vocational or clock-hour courses.)
                                        All courses for which you want to use TA must be taken from nationally or regionally accredited institutions.  Also, to qualify for TA, the credit you earn for a course must be required for your degree program.
                                        Currently, TA is not authorized for courses for which you Continuing Education Units (CEUs), Professional Development Units (PDUs), non-accredited clock hours, or non-accredited contact hours.

                                        TA money goes directly to the institution you're taking courses from, not to you
                                            TA can only be used for tuition and tuition-related costs
                                            TA must be requested before you pay for a course; you will not be reimbursed by the Coast Guard for courses already taken
                                        
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Eligibility & Use Rules
                                    
                                    
                                        The following conditions are now in effect, on top of those which previously existed (under the horizontal line below).

                                        Only uniformed personnel who are on active duty (including Reservists on ADOS or EAD contracts) are eligible
                                            Only uniformed personnel in pay grades E-6 and below (as of the first day of the course) are eligible
                                            TA may only be used to pay for undergraduate courses
                                            TA may only be used to pay for up to 6 semester credits (or up to 9 quarter credits) per fiscal quarter
                                        In addition, applicants must:

                                        be making satisfactory progress toward completion of qualifications for their billets
                                            be making satisfactory progress toward watch-standing qualifications
                                            demonstrate satisfactory proficiency in their craft
                                            have demonstrated satisfactory conduct during the last six months
                                        Before commands can approve a TA application, "COs, OICs, or the first O-6/GS-15 in the chain-of-command" must ensure that applicants meet the above eligibility criteria (see ALCOAST 175/13, paragraph 4).  Commands are free to use any means they want to record the fact that they've verified that the above criteria were met.

                                        If you're applying for TA to work toward an undergraduate degree (associate's or bachelor's level) and you're using TA for the first time, you must have requested an education assessment and received a transcript from the Coast Guard Institute within the previous four years
                                            With one exception, TA may only be used for courses that are part of a degree program at a regionally- or nationally-accredited institution of higher learning
                                            The exception to the rule above is that TA may be used for foreign language courses which support the Coast Guard's foreign language program.  These are courses which help you acquire the ability to speak and write in a "strategic language" as identified by the foreign language program.  Such courses must be offered by regionally- or nationally-accredited institutions of higher learning.  Non-academic language programs are not funded with TA
                                            TA may only be used for courses you receive transferable college credit for.  This means you can't use TA if you receive CEUs (continuing education units), PDUs (professional development units), clock hours, or the like
                                            TA use may be limited or denied by individual commands based on factors such as your primary duties, staffing levels, etc
                                            If you're taking courses from a SOC (Service members Opportunity Colleges) institution, you must obtain a SOC Student Agreement after you complete 12 credits
                                            A passing grade for an undergraduate course is a "D"; for graduate courses, it's a "C"
                                            Coast Guard personnel (military or civilian) may not use TA and receive any GI Bill benefit for the same course(s)
                                        In addition to the rules above, TA is not authorized for any of the following:

                                        Courses you audit (i.e., don't get a grade for)
                                            Courses you previously took using TA funds
                                            Physical education or recreation courses not required by your college/university to complete your degree
                                            Courses being paid for by the Coast Guard as part of a higher education program (e.g., ACET, graduate school, etc.)
                                            Undergraduate students whose GPA is less than 2.0 for the previous 12 credits paid for with TA
                                            Graduate students whose GPA is less than 3.0 for the previous 12 credits paid for with TA
                                            A second degree at the same or lower educational level (if the first degree was paid for with TA)
                                            Contract or Non-Appropriated Fund (NAF) employees
                                            Personnel awaiting a punitive discharge, in confinement, on appellate leave, or awaiting an administrative separation with an other-than-honorable or general (under honorable conditions) discharge

                                    	Many people who are taking college courses using TA don't realize that certain fees are covered by TA.  These include:

                                        Fees for the laboratory part of a certain courses (e.g., chemistry course, to cover chemicals and broken glassware)
                                            Studio fees (e.g., to pay for models or consumables like paints, clay, darkroom chemicals, etc.)
                                            Shop fees (e.g., for things like wood, broken tools, etc.)
                                            Library fees, and Internet or technology fees required for distance learning courses
                                        Fees and costs not directly related to the course you are taking (e.g., fees all students must pay regardless of the course they're taking) are not covered by TA.  These include things like:

                                        Application, entrance, registration, or enrollment fees, record maintenance fees, student activity fees, student ID fees, parking fees, general technology fees, equipment (e.g., PDAs), manuals, or books
                                            Non-consumable materials, assembled items available commercially (e.g., computers, tools, TVs, etc.)
                                            Flight time, flying lessons, or non-credit aviation courses
                                            Internet or technology fees all students must pay
                                            Personal/home Internet service fees
                                            The cost of books, supplies, tools or equipment required for specific courses but not included in a course-related fee
                                        If TA doesn't cover the whole cost of a course and if you're eligible for benefits under either the Montgomery GI Bill (Active Duty) or the Post-9/11 GI Bill you can use an option called Top-up. Top-up allows you to get reimbursed for any costs not covered by TA.
                                        Tuition and certain fees not covered by TA will show up on your TA authorization under the heading STU SHARE (student share), which means you have to pay for them.  However, if you want to use Top-up to cover those costs, just print out a copy of your TA authorization, print TOP UP across the top of the form, and send it to the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA).
                                        If you had to pay for fees you couldn't list on your TA request, you may receive Top-up reimbursement for them, as well. But you will need documentation showing that those fees were not included on your TA authorization and send it with the documentation described above to the DVA.
                                        Your 36-month GI Bill entitlement will be reduced by a certain amount when you use Top-up. To calculate the amount of time which will be deducted from your entitlement, go here if you're eligible for new (Post-9/11) GI Bill benefits, or here if you're eligible for Montgomery GI Bill (Active Duty) benefits.

                                        
                                
                                
                                    
                                        TA & Service Obligation for Officers
                                    
                                    
                                        Officers (regular and Reserve) incur service obligations when they use TA.  Specifically, regular officers incur a two-year service obligation for each course they use TA to pay for.  The obligation begins on the date the most recent course taken ends.  For Reserve officers, the obligation is for four years.  Read ALCOAST 012/09 for the complete policy.

                                        
                                            ALCOAST 012/09
                                            

                                        These obligations run concurrently, not consecutively.  That is, if you use TA to pay for another course that ends before a previous obligation ends, your obligation is extended to the date that's two or four years after the date you completed the most recent course paid for with TA.

                                        You will be unable to apply online for TA if the following applies to you:Missing grades over 60 days from course end date

                                            Requesting TA for courses that have already started
                                            Requesting TA for lower level courses which are less than highest education level awarded
                                            No degree plan in records
                                        TA is not authorized for courses leading to a lateral or lower level degree than you already possess (i.e. Second Associate's or Bachelor's degree).

                                        After you have completed your tuition assistance form and registered for class, you may still drop/change courses without penalty as long as you notify both the base education center and the school. If you drop a course after the drop/ add period, you must still notify the base ed center and the school but you are liable for the cost of tuition, unless you qualify for waiver of tuition assistance reimbursement.
                                        If you receive a grade of incomplete from a school, you have as much time as the school allows you to clear the incomplete or 12 months from the end of the term, whichever comes first, to clear the incomplete. If you fail to provide a grade that clears the incomplete by that time, we are obligated to recover the tuition assistance.
                                        No Tuition Assistance for post-masters degree course work or degree.

                                                In addition to degree programs, TA is available to Soldiers to complete a high school diploma and to complete certificate programs. However, TA will not be approved to complete credentials at the same or a lower educational level. TA is not authorized for programs beyond a master's degree.
                                                All eligible Soldiers will request TA through GoArmyEd.
                                                By law, officers who use TA incur a service obligation. Active Duty officers incur an Active Duty Service Obligation (ADSO) of two years and Reserve Component officers incur a Reserve Duty Service Obligation (RDSO) of four years. The ADSO/RDSO is calculated from the date of completion of the last course for which TA was used.
                                                Non-Army service members must obtain TA through their branch of Service. This policy has been mutually agreed upon by all Services.
                                                Further details on the provisions of TA are found in AR 621-5.

                                    	The Department of Defense (DoD) has directed a uniform TA fiscal policy across the military services. Per semester hour cap is $250 and the fiscal year ceiling is $4,500. The Army will pay 100 percent of the tuition and authorized fees charged by a school up to the established per semester hour cap and fiscal year ceiling.
                                            Current Army policy limits TA to 130 semester hours of undergraduate credit or baccalaureate degree, whichever comes first and 39 semester hours of graduate credit or masters degree whichever comes first. The 39 semester hour limit applies to all credits taken after completion of a baccalaureate degree.
                                            Authorized fees covered by TA are mandatory fees that are associated with an individual course enrollment. Non-refundable fees and fees that are not linked to individual course enrollments (e.g., application fees, graduation fees) are not covered by TA.

                                        Soldiers must request TA through www.GoArmyEd.com prior to the course start date or before the school's late registration period.
                                            TA is requested on a course-by-course basis.
                                            GoArmyEd will notify the Soldier whether the TA is approved or not. If the TA request is not approved, GoArmyEd will advise the Soldier of the reason and next steps.
                                            All drops/withdrawals must take place through GoArmyEd. Soldiers who do not successfully complete a class will be required to repay the TA. Soldiers who are unable to successfully complete a class due to military reasons must request a Withdrawal for Military Reasons through GoArmyEd and complete all required steps to ensure that they will not be charged.
                                            If the Soldier wishes to take a class with a school that does not participate in the electronic GoArmyEd class schedule, a TA Request Authorization form must be completed in GoArmyEd. The TA Request Authorization will be routed to an Army Education Counselor to be reviewed and approved. Soldiers should allow extra time for this. If the TA Request Authorization is approved, the Soldier will be notified by email. Soldiers must print the approved TA Request Authorization form in GoArmyEd, provide it to the school and enroll directly with the school.
                                            Soldiers must submit a signed TA Statement of Understanding (TA SOU) each year. Soldiers in the rank of E7 or above do not need their commander's signature. However, by signing this document they agree to the terms of this TA SOU. Soldiers in the rank of E6 or below must have their commander's signature. GoArmyEd will send a notice to students 90 days before the due date.

                                                    Many colleges require that students submit test results as part of the admission application process. Both the ACT and the SAT are nationally administered standardized tests that help colleges evaluate candidates. All schools accept either test interchangeably. As you begin to think about college and creating the best application package possible, your admissions plan should begin with the question, "Which test should I take?"

                                                            The ACT Assessment test is an admissions requirement at some colleges. The instrument consists of a battery of four academic tests that measure academic development in English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science Reasoning. The Assessment provides scores on the four tests, a composite score, and seven sub scores which provide more detailed information concerning an individual's academic development.

                                                            The SAT is a globally recognized college admission test that lets you show colleges what you know and how well you can apply that knowledge. It tests your knowledge of reading, writing and math— subjects that are taught every day in high school classrooms. You can take the general SAT, or the SAT Subject, which many colleges use for admission, for course placement, and to advise students about course selection.

                                                    I would like to get a graduate degree
                                                    If you are applying to graduate or business school, you will be required to take a standard examination. Few students understand the benefits of standardized testing, but they help admissions officials determine who is capable of withstanding the rigors of graduate school. Different schools have different admission requirements, so you’ll need to see which test is right for you.

                                                            The GRE is a standardized test that is an admissions requirement for most graduate schools in the United States. Created and administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS) in 1949, the exam aims to measure verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, analytical writing, and critical thinking skills that have been acquired over a long period of time and that are not related to any specific field of study.

                                                            Yes, reimbursement is authorized for eligible military personnel. DANTES funds only one administration each of the GRE General (CBT) and GRE Subject (paper-based) exams per lifetime for eligible Service members. GRE Subject exams taken at a National Test Center are not reimbursable. DANTES reimburses eligible military examinees only for the test fee after the administration of the test. Military examinees must seek reimbursement within 90 days from the test date.

                                                    There is no single path that will prepare you for a legal education. However, there are core skills and values that will provide you with a solid foundation. The LSAT is an integral part of the law school admission process. It provides a standard measure of acquired reading and verbal reasoning skills that law schools can use as one of several factors in assessing applicants.

                                                    Right now in the US, not enough people have the required skills or knowledge to fill available jobs. 4 million available jobs, in fact. The GED® test can help solve this economic need by opening the doors for millions of adult learners to college courses, apprenticeships and job training—the pathway adults need to gain skills and knowledge, fill these jobs, and care for their families.

                                                            A high school diploma remains the primary ticket to many entry-level jobs, and is also a prerequisite for promotions, occupational training, and postsecondary education. In an ideal society, everyone would graduate from high school. Although that is not a reality today, GED Testing Service offers the only nationally recognized opportunity to earn a high school-equivalency credential.
                                                        
                                                    
                                                
                                                
                                                    
                                                        
                                                            Is the GED funded by DANTES?
                                                            Limited reimbursement or DANTES-sponsored voucher for eligible military personnel. DANTES funding by Reimbursement or Voucher is available until the new 2014 GED computer-based assessment is released; and the paper-based GED test is retired.

                            Department of Defense (DoD) Voluntary Education Partnership Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
                            The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel Readiness provides overall policy guidelines for voluntary education programs in the Department of Defense. These responsibilities are accomplished through the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military Community and Family Policy, by the Chief, Continuing Education, in the Educational Opportunities Directorate.
                            The revision to the DoD Instruction 1322.25, Voluntary Education Programs, includes an appendix containing the uniform DoD Voluntary Education Partnership DoD MOU between DoD (OUSD, Personnel & Readiness) and Educational Institutions. The new instruction states all institutions providing high school completion and post secondary education programs through the DoD Tuition Assistance (TA) Program must agree to the new DoD MOU and have a signed copy on-file with DoD prior to service members receiving TA approval to attend their institution.

                            Meet the challenges of distance learning to achieve your educational goals.
                            Being prepared for challenges and working hard is already part of your life. Completing a distance learning program requires the same approach. The following tips will help you select a course of study best suited to meet your career goals, as well as how to plan and navigate your way each stage of the process.
                            
							
                            		
                            			How a student should select and complete distance learning courses
                            		
                            		
                                        Enroll for a definite reason that you can verbalize and outline on paper. Define solid goals: degree or knowledge needs, not frivolous purposes. Will the course or courses help advance your military career or academic goals?
                                            Obtain a clear, complete description of the course. Review the school catalog. Know exactly how your course fits into your degree plan. Ensure your home school will accept the course you are taking, and that the course will satisfy a definite degree requirement. Give your home school a copy of the description. Will the course fit where you need it?
                                            Consider enrolling with a friend. Study with a partner. Distance Learning students need a support group.
                                            If available, fully participate in discussions on your class site. Your virtual classmates and professor are very important to your academic success.
                                            Study in the same place for each study session. Choose an appropriate site. Apply yourself, and take a break when needed.
                                            Devise a reasonable study plan. Set aside time in your schedule to work on your course requirements.
                                            Check your plan against the course outline and study guide provided by the school. Ensure they both look realistic when balanced with your work schedule, family, and other obligations.
                                            Include milestones to be reached according to the course outline. Be reasonable. Set aside some time to reward yourself when those milestones are passed, not before!
                                            Include check points in your plan. Check your progress periodically. Be honest and serious.
                                            Students who execute their study plan are most likely to complete the course successfully.
                                            Tell someone you respect about your course. Discuss your course with that person occasionally. There is a difference between involvement and commitment.
                                            If necessary, determine who will administer your exams. If your Education Office can do this, make arrangements many weeks prior to your exam and coordinate with your school. Make sure you take your exam at the pre-arranged appointment time, as your Education Office may not be able to reschedule another exam time that meets your schedule.
                                            There are many sources of help while you study at a distance. The school is the most logical place to ask for help (consider your professor, school advisor, education counselor, on-base instructors, subject matter experts, or friends).
                                            Review feedback from instructors. Consider all graded or returned lessons. Review text materials to understand key concepts.
                                            Completing a distance learning course takes motivation and hard work. The good news is, once you have successfully completed a distance learning course, completing future courses will be much easier.

                                        Consider your life goal. Is this your final degree or are you after a later "big-name" school. What's in a school's name? Consider your strengths and skills.
                                            What is the total cost? Consider tuition and maintenance fees? Consider all yearly fees. Some "collection type" schools charge additional fees. Enroll when you are close to your target degree.
                                            What is your motivation for a degree? Is the degree for your military career, or to meet later civilian job requirements?
                                            Will "any school" suffice or is "name" important? If a BS or MS is your goal, what percentage of the graduates go on to higher degrees, and to which schools?
                                            Does the school accept ACE credit, prior learning, CLEP, and DSSTs? Must tests have been taken within a specified time, such as the last 10 years? Is there a limit on the kind or amount of testing credit?
                                            How is previous credit transferred? Are there fees for transfer? Is there a time limit on how recently the credit must have been earned? Are there unique rules for lower or upper-level credit transfer?
                                            Is the school a SOC or SOC network member? Does the school offer other ways that classes can be taken. Does it offer a contract for degree?
                                            What is the mode of delivery: pen and paper, video, audio, computer conferencing? Do you have the needed equipment?
                                            Is the degree completely external or is there an on-campus requirement? How many credits must you earn with the school? If there is an on-campus requirement, do your family and job commitments leave enough time to complete the degree? Are your family members and job supervisors supportive?
                                            Does the school's accreditation meet your needs? Will credit transfer where you need it later?
                                            When do you need your degree? How long will it take to finish? Getting an external degree is not easier than going to class with your friends; it's harder!
                                            What student services are provided? Examples include a toll free number, FAX, E-mail, quick turn around on assignments and provision of transcripts, a single source for books, etc.

                                        Determine your degree goal. Don't start with random courses unless you know they'll count.
                                            View the school's catalog on the web or order the catalog from the school you have selected. Study the degree requirements.
                                            Ensure you meet all entrance requirements.
                                            Request an evaluation to receive credit from the ACE Guide and any testing for credit you have completed.
                                            Apply for an evaluation of all credits earned from past military and civilian jobs, class attendance, other distance learning courses, and the Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).
                                            Identify your remaining requirements after the evaluation is complete. The school's list of required courses will allow you to plan alternatives and commit yourself for the long term.
                                            Before you embark on a multi-year journey, make the school commit itself. Have the institution do a degree plan.
                                            If pursuing an undergraduate degree, identify exams that may transfer into the degree program such as CLEP, DSSTs, Excelsior College Exams, or others from the DANTES Independent Study Catalog.
                                            Assess your potential for passing exams. Do you have prior experience with tests or strength in certain subject areas?
                                            Identify independent study courses to replace "difficult-to-get" courses.
                                            Draw up a formal written plan. Send a copy of your plan to the institution for approval and commitment. Keep records of all work, discussions, and agreements.

                                Discuss your goals with an education counselor and determine a strategy to meet your long-term objectives.
                                    With the assistance of your counselor, or by reference materials provided by DANTES, select a properly accredited college or university offering a program that best meets your education objectives.
                                    Compare and investigate different colleges or universities before making your decision. Your Service education office can verify whether a school has an agreement with DoD that verifies tuition assistance availability.
                                    Work with your selected institution's academic advisor to develop a degree plan or program of study outlining your education path.
                                    Examine the course description. Verify the selected course or degree will meet your needs and can be transferred or accepted toward follow-on degrees.
                                    Complete your Service's Tuition Assistance Program funding request (if applicable).
                                    Follow your Service's instruction about enrollment procedures, payment, tuition assistance responsibilities, and any other Service-unique requirements to get started.

                                            Students and counselors frequently call the Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support 
                                            (DANTES) Distance Learning Office with questions about the distance learning program. This information

                                            Students use distance learning to take high school, college, technical, or vocational courses. 
                                            Students learn at a distance using combinations of textbooks, lessons, workbooks, video and 
                                            audio tapes, computer conferencing, and course information delivered by CD-ROM, the Internet, 
                                            satellite TV, cable TV and E-mail. They may take a single course or many courses to complete a 
                                            degree program. Most programs require no physical attendance at the school's campus.

                                        * DANTES does not have college or university catalogs to provide to service members. Students may view school catalogs on the web. Home page web links for all of the schools in the DANTES Catalogs are available from the online catalogs. Students should examine institution requirements, course descriptions, costs, course delivery and testing requirements before enrolling.

                                            Some courses have prerequisites. There may be other requirements that must be completed prior to enrolling in a course or degree program. The school catalog or school advisor can provide this information. Students must receive education center counseling and approval prior to enrollment if tuition assistance is requested. If a student enrolls without going through an education center, tuition assistance may be denied.

                                            Counselors recommending courses should consider the ability and experience of the student. Unless the student has demonstrated successful completion of distance learning courses, enrollment in one course at a time is generally recommended.
                                            
                                    
                                

                                
                                    
                                    
                                        How do counselors know if students "need" a distance learning course?
                                    
                                    
                                        
                                            Locally conducted and attended college or university courses usually are best for most students. However, if a desired course or degree is not available or cannot be taken because of the student's duty schedule, a distance learning course may be able to provide a satisfactory alternative.
                                            
                                    
                                

                                
                                    
                                    
                                        How are students enrolled?
                                    
                                    
                                        Students planning to enroll in courses found in the DANTES catalogs must contact the school to register and enroll.
                                        * Before enrolling in a course or degree program, students should consider the possibility of receiving credit through the Military Evaluations Program (using the ACE Guide at http://militaryguides.acenet.edu), and through the DANTES Credit-By-Examination program. Many of the SOC (Service members Opportunity Colleges at http://www.soc.aascu.org) schools also offer contracts-for-degree in which specific use of nontraditional credit is itemized (and usually maximized) for military students.
                                        ** Before applying to any school, students need to determine if they can meet the school's requirements for course cost, term lengths, delivery modes, student-to-instructor contacts, and testing policies. Students also need to be aware of the school's drop/add date for each course, policies for awarding "W, F, and I" grades, and all refund policies and dates. Some degree programs require on-campus residency. Students need to be aware of all these details to determine if they can meet all of the school's policies and should enroll in courses with a particular school.
                                    
                                

                                
                                    
                                    
                                        How much tuition assistance will a student receive?
                                    
                                    
                                        In general, subject to specific Service policies, specified dollar limits, yearly caps, and availability of funding, students will be provided either up-front or reimbursable tuition assistance which may cover 100% of their tuition and fees.
                                        * Students should contact their Service education counselors for current tuition assistance policies and requirements, as these frequently change. It is the student's responsibility to know and understand their Service's tuition assistance policy.
                                        ** Students may be required to make a separate payment to the school bookstore for books and materials.
										*** Although schools agree to notify DANTES before changing tuition and generally attempt to avoid changing fees during a school year, prices can change before they are entered into the online Catalogs or the current CD ROM edition of the DANTES Catalogs is issued. Students should always check with the school to determine the correct price before enrolling.
                                    
                                

                                
                                    
                                    
                                        Must students pay tuition in advance or can they make installment payments?
                                    
                                    
                                        Some schools permit installment payments. This agreement is between the student and the school. The student must pay all costs before the school will issue a grade report.
                                        * Encourage students to discuss refund policies with schools before enrolling or before signing contracts.

                                        Who pays for the postage on distance learning materials?
                                    
                                    
                                        
                                            Students pay the postage for materials sent to the distance learning school.

                                        Why should a student consider a distance learning course?
                                    
                                    
                                        
                                            A student may consider a distance learning course to meet prerequisites, accelerate degree completion, complete courses not conducted locally, complete courses when TDY or duty prevent class attendance, gain personal enrichment and satisfaction, or prepare for a second career. Some students find that independent study is their preferred method of learning.

                                            William A. Owings, Ed.D.
                                        
                                        
                                            Prior research on Troops to Teachers (TTT) from 2005 and 2009 using both principal surveys and measured student achievement affirms that Troops teachers are effective instructors, are likely to work in high-poverty, high-minority schools, teach critical subjects, use research-based instructional and classroom management practices, and plan to stay in the profession longer than traditionally prepared teachers with the same years of teaching experience. The Owings Study finds that the current TTT cohorts are meeting the same high benchmarks in these essential domains, identifies teacher preparation programs factors that helped them succeed in the classroom, and assesses these within the context of recent teacher effectiveness research.

                            Department of Defense (DoD) Voluntary Education Partnership Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
                            The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel Readiness provides overall policy guidelines for voluntary education programs in the Department of Defense. These responsibilities are accomplished through the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military Community and Family Policy, by the Chief, Continuing Education, in the Educational Opportunities Directorate.
                            The revision to the DoD Instruction 1322.25, Voluntary Education Programs, includes an appendix containing the uniform DoD Voluntary Education Partnership DoD MOU between DoD (OUSD, Personnel & Readiness) and Educational Institutions. The new instruction states all institutions providing high school completion and post secondary education programs through the DoD Tuition Assistance (TA) Program must agree to the new DoD MOU and have a signed copy on-file with DoD prior to service members receiving TA approval to attend their institution.

                                                The online TCO Academic Testing Course provides comprehensive examination information in a 24/7 delivery mode so that potential TCO candidates nominated by their headquarters/major commands can receive standardized TCO training in a self-paced program. This has also reduced travel and per diem costs for the Military Services.

                                                    DoD Worldwide Education Symposium
                                                    Every three years since 1994, the Department of Defense (DoD) has hosted the DoD Worldwide Education Symposium to provide professional development opportunities for those who support the Military Voluntary Education Program. The most recent symposium, held July 23 - 26, 2012, was very successful with over 1,800 attendees.
												
                                                The next Worldwide was scheduled to occur during the summer of 2015. However, due to current fiscal constraints and the uncertainty about future budgets, DANTES has been advised to cease planning efforts for the 2015 event. Until we are able to reinstate Worldwide, we will work on other training technologies and developmental opportunities to ensure our education professionals stay at the top of their game.

                                The online TCO Academic Testing Course provides comprehensive examination information in a 24/7 delivery mode
                                so that potential TCO candidates nominated by their headquarters/major commands can receive standardized TCO training in a self-paced program. This has also reduced travel and per diem costs for the Military Services.

                                        How do you get TCO Training?
                                    
                                    
                                        To get TCO training you must be nominated by your headquarters/major command in order to be granted access to the online Test Control Officer (TCO) Academic Testing Course. Once you have access, the online course provides comprehensive, standardized TCO training in a self-paced, 24/7 delivery mode.
                                        A potential TCO/ATCO candidate must be nominated by their headquarters/major command before they will be allowed access to the online TCO Academic Testing Course. Once the TCO nomination package is received at DANTES, the DANTES administrator will establish an account to allow access to the system. The system automatically sends a "welcome" email to the new student, including login and password information.
                                        While the course is estimated to take 3 days, the student has 30 days to complete the course and final exam. The system notifies DANTES of successful completion, which is then documented in the nomination package. For DANTES Test Sites located in Europe and the Middle East, the headquarters/major command must contact usarmy.badenwur.usareur.mbx.dantes-euro@mail.mil.

                                        Military Education Centers interested in establishing a base-sponsored National Test Center (NTC) coordinate with a local or on-base institution (college or university), the base Commanding Officer and DANTES. The advantages of having a NTC on or near base are many. Computer-based testing reduces administrative work associated with paper-based test administration; DANTES funds the test and examination fee, and students receive instant score results.
                                        At the base-sponsored NTC, the institution is responsible for providing staff, computers, technical support, and Internet connection. If the NTC can be located on station, the base provides the room/space for the computer lab. It is a win-win situation for the institution if they already have a computer lab, as it maximizes the use of their computers and generates funding to maintain and operate their facility. Service members’ pay nothing while testing on base and receive instant score results.

                            3rd Party Assessment Program
                            The purpose of the 3rd Party Assessment is to assess the quality of off-duty post-secondary educational programs and services used by service members regardless of location or duty assignment and to assist in the improvement of these education programs and services. This periodic assessment will ensure the education programs provided to service members funded by a tuition assistance program are of the same high quality and meet the same academic criteria of quality higher education.

                            Department of Defense (DoD) Voluntary Education Partnership Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
                            The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel Readiness provides overall policy guidelines for voluntary education programs in the Department of Defense. These responsibilities are accomplished through the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military Community and Family Policy, by the Chief, Continuing Education, in the Educational Opportunities Directorate.
                            The revision to the DoD Instruction 1322.25, Voluntary Education Programs, includes an appendix containing the uniform DoD Voluntary Education Partnership DoD MOU between DoD (OUSD, Personnel & Readiness) and Educational Institutions. The new instruction states all institutions providing high school completion and post secondary education programs through the DoD Tuition Assistance (TA) Program must agree to the new DoD MOU and have a signed copy on-file with DoD prior to service members receiving TA approval to attend their institution.
