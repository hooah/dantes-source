By building a love for reading, you will improve your comprehension and your vocabulary. Along the way, you will gain more confidence in your skills, including writing and the ability to express yourself, because you have the power of a large vocabulary at your disposal. Building a large vocabulary isn't very difficult, but it is work. Your course textbooks are another source for new words - look for the glossary and study those words. If there are any words you don't know as you read materials for your classes, make flash cards or a list and study them. Your education center or chosen school may have a reading assessment test which can help you determine at what grade level you are currently reading. If you find your reading level is low, then there are programs available to help improve your reading and perhaps unlock your potential as a reader. Check with your education center to try the Online Academic Skills Course (OASC) - http://www.nelnetsolutions.com/dantes/",

Developing your ability to organize your study area, your time, plan assignments and projects will be critical to your overall success in the college arena. You may not have them fully developed today, but after successfully completing a few classes you will get the hang of it. Consider taking a face-to-face college orientation or study skills class. Often these are taught at community colleges but may be available through the school of your choice. These classes often provide students with study tools and training to use the library and digital resources. You should consider taking the time to develop your academic organizational skills before taking a distance learning class. Other keys to success - (1) Read the course syllabus carefully and ask questions of your instructor as needed. Your instructor expects to get questions from students, be proactive and ask away! (2) Use a calendar to record your assignment due dates, including reading textbooks and other course materials. This reminder will serve as very visual reminder and help keep you on time and on task. (3) If there is group work, make contact with your group members early so you can get the assignment started and of course completed on time. Begin by introducing yourself and getting the ball rolling by organizing the division of labor. Set firm due dates for completion of each assignment, allow enough time for any additional discussion or rework as needed. (4) Be flexible - even the best plans may require adjustment – accept this and rework your plan as needed.",

Recognizing when you are having a problem with a particular bit of content, then taking the time and risk of asking a question is an important aspect of your educational experience and development. If at first posting an open question to a course discussion board seems intimidating, send a private email to the professor. They know where students tend to have issues and if your question relates to one of those, they may post additional information to the class. If it is specific to your needs, they should respond directly and only to you. The key is to communicate - the professor cannot read your mind.

Taking a Distance Learning class is probably not the best option for you at this time in your academic preparation. In the distance learning environment, you will definitely feel alone and isolated.
