                                        <p>To get TCO training you must be nominated by your headquarters/major command in order to be granted access to the online Test Control Officer (TCO) Academic Testing Course. Once you have access, the online course provides comprehensive, standardized TCO training in a self-paced, 24/7 delivery mode.</p>
                                        <p>A potential TCO/ATCO candidate must be nominated by their headquarters/major command before they will be allowed access to the online TCO Academic Testing Course. Once the TCO nomination package is received at DANTES, the DANTES administrator will establish an account to allow access to the system. The system automatically sends a "welcome" email to the new student, including login and password information.</p>
                                        <p>While the course is estimated to take 3 days, the student has 30 days to complete the course and final exam. The system notifies DANTES of successful completion, which is then documented in the nomination package. For DANTES Test Sites located in Europe and the Middle East, the headquarters/major command must contact <a href="mailto:dantes@eur.army.mil">dantes@eur.army.mil</a>.<br /><br /></p>
